# License Plate Detector Model

Place your trained YOLOv8 license plate detector model here as `license_plate_detector.pt`.

## How to Get the Model

### Option 1: Train Your Own
Follow the [YOLOv8 training guide](https://github.com/computervisioneng/train-yolov8-custom-dataset-step-by-step-guide) using the [license plate dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4).

### Option 2: Pre-trained Model
Check the [original project's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ComputerVisionEngineer) for a pre-trained model.

### For Testing
If you don't have a license plate detector yet, the code will fail. You can temporarily modify `main.py` to use the general YOLOv8 model, though accuracy will be lower.
